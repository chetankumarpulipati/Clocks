# DigitalClock
**Analog and Digital Clock with Python**

This repository contains Python scripts to create both analog and digital clocks using the tkinter library. The analog clock displays the time with traditional clock hands, while the digital clock presents the time in a digital format.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter library

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/analog-digital-clock-python.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd analog-digital-clock-python
```

3. Run the desired clock script:

- To run the digital clock:
```bash
python digital_clock.py
```

- To run the analog clock:
```bash
python analog_clock.py
```

### Digital Clock (`digital_clock.py`)
The `digital_clock.py` script creates a digital clock interface using tkinter. It continuously updates the displayed time in the format "HH:MM:SS AM/PM".

### Analog Clock (`analog_clock.py`)
The `analog_clock.py` script generates an analog clock interface using tkinter. It continuously updates the clock hands to display the current time.

### Screenshots
Include screenshots of both the digital and analog clocks here.

### Credits
- This code was adapted from various sources and tutorials on tkinter and Python programming.

### Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to suggest improvements or fix any bugs.

### Disclaimer
This project is for educational purposes only. It may contain bugs or errors, and the accuracy of the time displayed in the clocks depends on the system's time settings.
